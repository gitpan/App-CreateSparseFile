NAME
    App::CreateSparseFile - Create sparse file

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.02 of App::CreateSparseFile (from Perl
    distribution App-CreateSparseFile), released on 2014-12-05.

SYNOPSIS
    See create-sparse-file.

FUNCTIONS
  create_sparse_file(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Create sparse file.

    Examples:

     create_sparse_file( name => "file.bin", size => "30G");

    Create a sparse file called file.bin with size of 30GB.

    Sparse file is a file with a predefined size (sometimes large) but does
    not yet allocate all its (blank) data on disk. Sparse file is a feature
    of filesystem.

    I usually create sparse file when I want to create a large disk image
    but do not want to preallocate its data yet. Creating a sparse file
    should be virtually instantaneous.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   interactive => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether or not the program should be interactive.

        If set to false then will not prompt interactively and usually will
        proceed (unless for dangerous stuffs, in which case will bail
        immediately.

    *   name* => *str*

    *   override => *bool* (default: 0)

        Whether to override existing file.

        If se to true then will override existing file without warning. The
        default is to prompt, or bail (if not interactive).

    *   size* => *str*

        Size (e.g. 10K, 22.5M).

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

     (any)
