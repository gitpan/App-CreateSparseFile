=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sparse file is a file with a predefined size (sometimes large) but does not yet
allocate all its (blank) data on disk. Sparse file is a feature of filesystem.

I usually create sparse file when I want to create a large disk image but do not
want to preallocate its data yet. Creating a sparse file should be virtually
instantaneous.
